As I was playing Stanley Parable this week I was thinking about agency, but I felt like the agency exhibited in this game isn't necessarily that different from some other story based games that I've played. You are still limited to going to certain places in the building, even if the narrator tries to make you think that this isn't supposed to happen or be possible. 
However, what it did make me consider is how much I hated the narrator. And it also made me think about winning, which is the result of agency.
The game has many endings, but many of them can't really be considered winning. Of these endings, I'm not sure many of them can be considered winning. My personal goal was to do everything possible to beat the narrator, so for me, the confusion ending seemed like winning. However, maybe for someone else who wanted to cooperate and help the narrator tell his story, the freedom ending may have been the ending where they win. In this way, 'winning' a game really depends on what the player wants to get out of the game. 
This week, however, I also found something else that I think warrants discussing in class. A new way to play the game: breaking the game.
When playing the Stanley Parable this week, I was inspired to go one step above beating the narrator, into changing the game itself to do what I wanted it to. I made it so that I could jump anywhere I wanted too, and I could walk at super speed.
This required me to open up the game's code and play around with it, tweaking different things to get different results. Instead of exploring the halls of the office, I was navigating the lines of code that determined how those walls worked.
Is cheating a way of playing the game? I’m not sure, as it doesn’t necessarily happen within the game. But it is still an action that the player can take within their experience of playing the game.
